    'Harvesting calendar help farmers connect with wide network of buyers and create timely market linkage. By posting when their crops are likely to be ready for harvest, farmers share information on expected timing and quantity of pre-harvest crops to potential buyers and establish trade contacts.',
    "For example, a farmer who knows that his crop will be ready for harvest in a few weeks can contact potential buyers, negotiate prices, and plan for transportation and delivery. This can help to ensure that the farmer's crop is sold quickly and efficiently, minimizing the risk of spoilage, waste, or financial losses due to missed market opportunities",
    'In addition, a harvesting calendar can help farmers to coordinate their harvesting activities with other farmers in their area, creating opportunities for bulk sales and shared transportation to market. This can help to reduce costs and increase profits for all farmers involved',
    'Overall, a harvesting calendar can be a valuable tool for farmers looking to establish timely market linkages and maximize the value of their crop harvests. By providing information on expected harvest timing and quantity, farmers can plan ahead and establish connections with potential buyers, helping to ensure that their crops are sold quickly and efficiently.',

Over the years of studying commodity nature & market dynamics, we understood ‘Time Value Depreciation’ as the root cause of farmer’s financial distress. When asset value keeps melting like an ice cube, its highly impossible to increase bargaining power of farmer. As a solution to this problem, AgMart felt the necessity to develop national harvesting calendar which act as reservoir of pre-harvest crops to ensure predictability and tradability of goods.`,
